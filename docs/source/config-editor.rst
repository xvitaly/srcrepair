In the first column **Variable** you must specify variable name (eg. ``cl_cmdrate``), and in the second **Value** -- its value (eg. ``66``). Value can be omitted.

Variable name must not contain any spaces, commentaries, etc. Value can be both double-quoted, or without them. If value contains spaces, double quotes are mandatory.

All commentaries are forbidden and will be removed on save/load procedures to reduce config file size and increase its loading speed.
