Troubleshooting and recovery
==========================================

To run Steam client recovery, enable **Clean .blob files from Steam directory** or/and **Clean all registry entries** (require admin rights; not available on non-Windows platforms) checkboxes, then press **Cleanup Now!** button.

Warning! Steam client will be automatically terminated (if running).

Known issues, can be resolved by this tool:

 * Steam logon errors;
 * errors like **Steam servers are not available**, **This game is not available at this time**, **No Steam connection**, **Could not connect to Steam network**, etc.;
 * endless Steam connection to servers;

 * some other issues.

Principle of operation
============================================

 * If **Clean .blob files from Steam directory** is checked, SRC Repair will get Steam installation directory path, find and remove files with .blob extension, and force Steam recovery on next launch. Warning! Steam can force you to login again after performing this action.
 * If **Clean all registry entries** is checked, SRC Repair will remove ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam`` registry key, modify some values in ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Valve\Steam`` (only when running with admin rights), and force Steam recovery on next launch. You will need to select Steam language from list.

.. index:: troubleshooting, path checker
.. _cleanup-pathcheck:

Installation path checker
============================================

This tool will automatically check for restricted (non-ASCII) symbols in Steam installation directory path. Steam path should contain only latin letters and numbers. All other can cause major issues with games, compiled without Unicode support.

If any restricted symbols were found, a warning message will be shown. Also you will see a red sign in **General information** section.

This tool starts automatically with SRC Repair and cannot be disabled.
