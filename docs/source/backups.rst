Managing backup files
==========================================

You can select multiple backups by pressing **Ctrl** or **Shift**.

Plain text backup files can be viewed or edited by a :ref:`default text editor <settings-advanced>`. Just select such file and press **Edit in Notepad** button on the main toolbar.

Binary files with **bud** extension can be opened by any Zip-archiver.

BackUp types
==========================================

Typical backup file name ``Container_UNIXTIME.bud`` consists of prefix **Container**, **UNIXTIME** -- current datetime in UnixTime format and extension **bud**.

BUD-files are standard Zip-archives, which contains removed by program files with keeping the original directory hierarchy.

The names of the registry backup files (only in version for Microsoft Windows) are generated as follows:

 * ``Game_AutoBackUp_UNIXTIME.reg`` -- automatic backup of game video settings;
 * ``Game_Options_UNIXTIME.reg`` -- manual backup of game video settings;
 * ``Source_Options_UNIXTIME.reg`` -- manual backup of all Source Engine games video settings;
 * ``Steam_BackUp_UNIXTIME.reg`` -- manual backup of all Steam settings, stored in Windows registry.
